This period is sometimes called the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA), or for how long the stimuli remain on the screen. There are two conditions for the stimuli: congruent (HHHHH or SSSSS) or incongruent (SSHSS or HHSHH). For this task, the participant has to identify the middle letter by pressing either the letter ‘s’ or ‘h’ on the keyboard. After the stimulus has disappeared, there is a blank screen where the participant has up to 800ms to provide a response. After the response, a blank screen is presented for 300ms. The participant is then provided feedback to let them know whether they pressed the correct button or not. A ‘+’ is shown for a correct response and a ‘-’ is shown for an incorrect response.

One of the helpful features in OpenSesame is the ability to copy and paste a linked component. This means that they are joined, and if you change one of the components, both of them change. This can save a lot of time if the same components are being used with the same settings. In the extended template, the two outer loops (practice_loop and experimental_loop) are independent, but all the components inside them are linked.

If we left the components like this, OpenSesame would display one and then the other. We need to use a bit of Python trickery to control which component is displayed depending on the response. If you click on trial_sequence, you will see a list of all the components within it. There is a second column called Run if. By default, this is set to always, so each component is displayed on every trial. We can modify this and use the correct variable that is updated on every trial. So if the participant pressed the correct button, this would be recorded as a 1, and if they pressed the wrong button, this would be recorded as a 0. Where it says always, change it to [correct] == 1 next to correct_response, and [correct] == 0 next to incorrect_response. The square brackets means we want to access a variable, and 1 and 0 refers to a correct or incorrect response. The two equals signs compares the values either side of the ==. If they match, it is evaluated as true, and if they do not, it is evaluated as false. Therefore, when we have a correct response, correct_response is run, and when we have an incorrect response, incorrect_response is run.
