This demonstrates the automaticity of reading as identifying the font colour of a congruent word (e.g. blue) is faster than identifying the font colour of an incongruent word (e.g. blue). When the word and colour are incongruent, the interference causes a delay in identifying the colour of the font. We will create a single block of trials to demonstrate the task.

The design of your experiment will be shown in the Overview window, and it is displayed sequentially down the screen from the components at the start of the experiment to the components at the end of the experiment. The backbone of an experiment is created through loop and sequence components. A loop component   repeats what is inside it and defines any variables to use. A sequence component   contains other components such as a screen showing text that make up a single trial. Therefore, you would place a sequence component within a loop component to control how many times the sequence is repeated. Drag a loop component  and place it after welcome in the overview window, and drag a sequence component   and place it inside the loop. When you release the sequence, it will ask whether you want it placing into the loop or after the loop. Press into the loop and make sure they are both given informative names such as block_loop for the loop component and trial_sequence for the sequence component. For the names of components, there are a number of rules you need to follow. They cannot start with numbers, and you cannot include any spaces. If you need spaces to make it easier to read, use an underscore. You should now have a window that looks like this:\n\nTherefore, once we define our variables later, trial_sequence and everything in it will repeat for however many times you specify in block_loop. We will now create a single trial within trial_sequence. In most psychology experiments, you include a fixation cross to start a trial and focus the participant’s attention in the location where you will be presenting the stimulus.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/conflict-tasks-stroop#the-building-blocks-of-creating-an-experiment","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Stroop task in OpenSesame","lvl4":"Creating the fixation dot","lvl3":"Creating the Stroop task","lvl2":"Tutorial 1.

The sketchpad window has a list of elements on the left hand side and a black screen with green lines to show where on the screen the elements would be placed. OpenSesame has a very handy fixation cross element called fixdot\n.\nClick on the fixdot element and this will turn your mouse into a pen icon. If you move the mouse around the black gridded screen, the coordinates are shown in the top right corner, and will change as you move around the screen. Place the fixdot element at 0,0 in the middle of the screen where the two green lines meet. This will place the fixdot in that position. There are two more things to change. Firstly, we can modify how long the stimuli are presented for by changing Duration. The default is keypress which would mean the screen will not disappear until the participant presses a button. We can change this to 500 to make the screen disappear after 500ms. Whenever you specify a duration in OpenSesame, it is stated in milliseconds. Therefore, to present something for 1 second, we would need to write 1000. Finally, we can change the name of the component to something informative such as fixation.

Name it word to keep track of all the components. This time instead of inserting a fixation cross, we need a text element  . After you have selected the text element, change the colour to green (all lowercase, it will say white by default). This will turn your mouse into a pen, and you need to click in the middle of the screen at 0,0 again to place it. When you click, it will ask you to enter some text. For now, just enter ‘Green’ as we want to show the participants colour words. This time, change Duration to 0.

We can leave Timeout to infinite, so the word will remain on the screen until the participant presses ‘g’ on the keyboard. As we set the duration of the word component to 0, the amount of time it is presented for is determined by keyboard_response. A keyboard response component does not display on the screen, so it keeps the display from the previous sketchpad component. A common mistake is to set a time for both components.

If it does not run, look back at all of the instructions and make sure you have not made any typos, and all the components are where they should be. Remember to press ‘g’ to indicate the color is green. We only have one trial up to yet, so it will only last around one second. However, it is helpful to keep testing an experiment to make sure it works before you add something else. It makes it much easier to debug your experiment if you know it worked previously.

The rules here are every column is a variable, and each row is an individual condition. The variables must have unique names, so you cannot repeat a variable name in the same or a different loop component. The first column will be called ‘empty_column’ by default. We will change this to ‘word’. We will change the second column to ‘colour’. It makes it easier if you use lower case letters as the variable names are case sensitive. We then need to populate the cells. We will have four words and colours: red, blue, yellow, and green. We want there to be some congruent and incongruent trials, so write each colour twice in the word column. In the colour column, we will pair red with blue, and yellow with green. So for each word, you should have one congruent colour and one incongruent colour. The grid should look like this:\n\nWe also need some additional variables that will be helpful for analysing the data later. We need a column called ‘congruent’ and a column called ‘correct_resp’. In the congruent column, write a 1 for every time the word and colour match, and a 0 for every time they do not match. In programming, 1 usually means true and 0 usually means false. This means that when we get the data afterwards, we can sort the responses by congruency and calculate whether the reaction times are longer in the incongruent condition. We also need to specify what is the correct response in order to use it in keyboard_response. In the correct_resp column, write the first letter of the colour variable for that row, e.g. r for red. You should now have a full grid like this:\n\nThis will create 8 trials, one for each row. Remember how it is the loop components that determine how many times the sequence component repeats.

OpenSesame lets you specify arguments using variables defined in a loop by entering the variable name surrounded by square brackets. For color, you should change it to say color = [colour]. This means that every time the component is called, the colour of the word will be determined by the colour variable in block_loop. We can then do the same for word and make sure it says text = [word]. Be very careful with your typing here as the variables are case sensitive. It should be typed exactly as it is in block_loop.

In addition, we should ensure that there are no problematic outliers. In the simplest case, there are response times that can be considered too fast or too slow. Anything below 100-200ms is unlikely to be a real response to the stimulus, as there is not enough time for the participant to perceive the stimulus and make a response. Conversely, response times above 1000-2000ms can be considered too slow and the participant may have been distracted. Response times on simple tasks are usually in the range of 400-700ms. A range of values at each end of the threshold have been presented as there is no one solution. It is important to read articles similar to the study you are conducting to see what they have done and justify your own decisions.\n\nFor the next step in the outlier removal procedure, some studies will remove response times above and below certain thresholds to ensure the response times are approximately normally distributed. The most common of these is two or three standard deviations above and below the mean (Lachaud and Renaud, 2011). Despite being commonly used, there is good reason not to do this including being biased by the very outliers they are trying to remove (Leys et al., 2013). If you are interested in using a more robust outlier removal method, Leys et al. (2013) present an alternative using the absolute median deviation. As the outlier removal method differs between studies and topic, in this guide we will just focus on removing incorrect responses, and response times below 100ms and above 1000ms. When it comes to designing your own studies, you will need to look more closely at these articles and methods.","type":"content","url":"/conflict-tasks-stroop#processing-the-data","position":47},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Stroop task in OpenSesame","lvl4":"Identifying extreme responses","lvl3":"Analysing response time data from the Stroop task","lvl2":"Tutorial 1.

Response times tend not to be normally distributed and the mean is often not an appropriate choice.

For my data, my median response is 668ms when the colour and word are congruent, and 787ms when they are incongruent. This shows that even in 28 (excluding the four removed) trials you can see the Stroop interference effect. For a real experiment, it would be better to include many more trials as you will get a more accurate estimate, but this is fine for demonstration purposes.

If this is written well enough, it should allow you to recreate their study as close as possible. In a lot of studies that use behavioural tasks, the authors provide diagrams of how their tasks are designed. The following diagram is from an EEG study by Rass et al. (2012).\n\nIn the second part of this section, we will create the task on the top which is called the Eriksen Flanker task. This follows a similar principle to the Stroop task as it aims to measure the impact of interference on task performance. However, instead of looking at word colour, it uses distracting information. The aim of the task is to identify the middle letter in a five letter string. The four outer letters are distractors, and on some trials they are congruent, and on others they are incongruent.

This randomness is usually introduced to stop participants just mindlessly clicking buttons to predictable stimuli. A stimulus then appears on the screen for 80ms. This period is sometimes called the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA), or for how long the stimuli remain on the screen. There are two conditions for the stimuli: congruent (HHHHH or SSSSS) or incongruent (SSHSS or HHSHH). For this task, the participant has to identify the middle letter by pressing either the letter ‘s’ or ‘h’ on the keyboard. After the stimulus has disappeared, there is a blank screen where the participant has up to 800ms to provide a response. After the response, a blank screen is presented for 300ms. The participant is then provided feedback to let them know whether they pressed the correct button or not. A ‘+’ is shown for a correct response and a ‘-’ is shown for an incorrect response.

The authors then explain that participants completed four blocks each containing 100 trials for a total of 400 trials. Between each block there is a rest period for the participant, but it does not say how long this period is. We will provide participants with a short 30 second break. Finally, we know that there are an equal number of congruent and incongruent stimuli in each block. As we have two types of congruent and incongruent stimuli, we can take a good guess that each one of these is presented 25 times in each block.

However, when you create a real experiment, it is a good idea to create a practice block to ensure the participant fully understands what they are doing. One of the helpful features in OpenSesame is the ability to copy and paste a linked component. This means that they are joined, and if you change one of the components, both of them change.

In the trial diagram, fixation is displayed for a random interval between 150ms and 250ms. In the Stroop task, we just set a static duration for 500ms. To create a variable duration, we will need to use our first bit of real Python code. Drag an inline_script component  into trial_sequence and place it before fixation. This component allows you to write Python code that can be used in your experiment. Rename it fix_duration as it will control how long our fixation dot is presented for. Within an inline script component, there are two tabs: Prepare and Run. The difference is not important here as we will only be creating a random number. However, if you were to create some complicated stimuli, it can take longer to prepare which affects the timing of the experiment. Therefore, it is better to prepare the stimuli in advance using the Prepare tab, and these can then be presented when necessary using the Run tab. For this example, we will just be writing two lines of code in the Prepare tab. On the first line, type:import random\n\nIt is very important these are all lowercase as Python code is case sensitive. This imports a library called random. A library is a collection of Python code which have specific functions. Random has different functions for creating random numbers. On a new line (it does not matter whether it is on line 2 or 3), we need to create a new variable called fix_duration using the following code:var.fix_duration = random.randint(150, 250)\n\nThis should look like the following:\n\nWe will take some time to unpack what this is doing. The first part var.fix_duration is creating a new variable called fix_duration. OpenSesame uses the var object to access and create experimental variables in inline scripts. We use the equals sign to assign fix_duration with a number created by the second part of the code. The second part random.randint(150, 250) is accessing a function within the random library called randint. This creates a random integer (whole number) between two numbers which you specify. As we want a random duration between 150ms and 250ms, we enter 150 and 250. Therefore, at the start of every trial (as we put fix_duration within block_loop), we get a new random value for fix_duration. For example, on the first trial it could be 250, on the second 178, and so on. This discourages the participant from mindlessly responding in a predictable fashion. As we created a new variable, we can use this to determine the Duration of fixation using square brackets.

Go-NoGo task with images"},"content":"For the structure of the whole task, the study explains there are six experimental blocks. There were five backgrounds used in the task, two smoking images, two non-smoking images, and a blank black background. In contrast to Rass et al. (2012) in the last section, there is quite a bit of missing information that we would need to fully reproduce the task. First, there is no mention of a practice block. Second, the study does not explain that the same black background is used in two blocks. Third, it is not directly explained that one background is shown per block. You can work it out from the introduction and other information in the methods section, but it is not directly specified. These details can be found in another paper which the methodology is based on (Petit et al. 2012). This is a common occurrence, as research teams often produce several publications based on the same method, but to prevent repeating the details in each article, they just reference the first. Finally, it does not explain what kind of break was provided to the participants in between each block. We will give people 30 seconds in order to rest their eyes.\n\nAlthough we are trying to recreate the task from Dedandt et al. (2017), there is one feature we are going to consciously change: the proportion of Go and NoGo trials. In order to measure inhibitory control, the response to Go stimuli should be be prepotent, meaning you should want to quickly respond, in comparison to the NoGo trials. A long list of studies have been criticised for having too many NoGo trials (Wessel 2017; for a graphical explanation, see \n\nFlexibleMeasures). Therefore, Go-NoGo tasks should have a maximum of 20% NoGo trials. As Dedandt et al. (2017) had 30% of the trials as NoGo, we are going to tweak it slightly to be a more valid measure of inhibitory control. Therefore, instead of including 93 Go and 40 NoGo trials per block, we will include 100 Go trials and 25 NoGo trials per block. Similar to the Eriksen Flanker task, we can visualise the structure of the whole experiment like this:","type":"content","url":"/conflict-tasks-gonogo#what-is-the-structure-of-the-whole-experiment","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Go-nogo task in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Creating the task in OpenSesame","lvl2":"Tutorial 3.

First, select a circle element  and make the necessary edits. The image element should look the same as in the previous step. The next element is the circle element. In the figure from Dedandt et al.

The first variable should be practice, and this should be set to 1 to indicate true. The second variable should be ‘image’ and set to ‘F1.jpg’ in reference to one of the images we saved in the file pool. Finally, we need a variable called ‘cue_type’ with one row set to ‘neutral’. During the practice block, it is best to avoid using stimuli that will be in the experimental blocks as the participants may get used to it. We are only defining this image here as we need the image to exist in our file pool or the experiment will crash.

Each block was identical, so we just presented each block sequentially and used the number of the fourth block to stop the two components from appearing. However, this time it is not so simple. We cannot simply label each block 1 to 5 as they are being randomly presented. What we need is to label each block as we go along so the background is free to be randomly presented. We can do this by inserting two inline script components called block_count between reset_feedback_1 and block_loop_1 in experimental_loop. Here we need to write var.block = var.block + 1 in the prepare tab. For each loop around experimental_loop this assigns var.block to equal the previous value for block plus one. The positioning of these two inline script components is very important. We want block_start to be outside of experimental_loop as we do not want it to be reset to 0 on on each cycle around the loop. We also want block_count to be in experimental_group and not block_loop_1. If we placed it in block_loop_1, it would increase by one on each trial. We want it to increase by one on each block, so by the time we get to the fifth block, block will equal 5. This means that we can enter some short Python code into block_sequence_1 to control when feedback_1 and end_of_break are run. Where it says always, change it to [block] < 5 for feedback_1 and end_of_break.

It is similar to the process of science. You have a hypothesis about a problem you are facing. You systematically test the sources of the problem until you isolate it, and then fix the problem. Most of this guide is based on using the OpenSesame GUI, and you will generally encounter fewer bugs than if you were to write your experiment using scripts. However, you will still encounter problems with implementing your ideas. Perhaps your images are not presenting how you want them to, or your feedback is not working. Solving these problems is very similar to solving problems in code. Some of this advice is taken from the excellent book on another Python based experiment builder called PsychoPy (Peirce and MacAskill, 2018).","type":"content","url":"/conflict-tasks-gonogo#tips-for-debugging-experiments","position":53},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Go-nogo task in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Steps to take when debugging","lvl2":"Tips for Debugging Experiments"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/conflict-tasks-gonogo#steps-to-take-when-debugging","position":54},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Go-nogo task in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Steps to take when debugging","lvl2":"Tips for Debugging Experiments"},"content":"Read the error messages carefully. If your experiment crashes,    OpenSesame does its very best to tell you what caused the problem.    Take task three as an example. I run the experiment, and as soon    as I press a key after the instructions, the experiment closes and    I get the following message:\n\nOpenSesame provides us with a reason for the experiment crashing: thevariable “cuetype” does not exist. At this point, you realise youmissed the underscore and it should be “cue_type”. Not all of theproblems will be this easy, but you should be directed by OpenSesameto the simple fixes.\n\nLook for typos carefully. In my own experience, a stray typo is one of the most common causes of an experiment crashing. As Python is case sensitive, it can be difficult to spot the difference between image and Image. Likewise, the difference between colour and color may be hard to spot. If you are struggling to find typos, you may just be too tired. Make sure you take frequent breaks to prevent being fatigued.\n\nTest your experiments in a separate window. When testing your experiments, always run it in a separate window until you know it works. If you run your experiment full-screen, you may have made a mistake that causes it to freeze and you will be unable to escape it. At best, you just have to restart your computer. At worst, you may have lost an hour’s worth of work if you did not save it beforehand.\n\nBe methodical. If you do not know the source of the problem immediately, change one thing at a time until the experiment works. In an ideal world, get into the habit of testing your experiment after every addition. This means you should know which addition caused the problem in the first place. You can then investigate what it is about that addition that caused the problems.","type":"content","url":"/conflict-tasks-gonogo#steps-to-take-when-debugging","position":55},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Go-nogo task in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Asking for help","lvl2":"Tips for Debugging Experiments"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/conflict-tasks-gonogo#asking-for-help","position":56},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Go-nogo task in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Asking for help","lvl2":"Tips for Debugging Experiments"},"content":"The aim of this guide is to provide you with support to create experiments on your own.

Example of expected behavior:Enter reaction time value in ms (between 1 and 2000 ms): 987\nInverse RT is: -1.01; Log RT is: 6.89.\n\nFor the log transformation, you will need the in-built mathematics package called “math”. We import math in the code below for you. To log-transform a numeric variable, you can call the math.log(variable) function.\n\n#your code here\nimport math\n\n","type":"content","url":"/variables-python-exercises#exercise-5-convert-reaction-time","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Python exercises: Variables","lvl3":"Exercise 6.

Combine these measure to a single score called the inverse accuracy score.\n\nBruyer and Brysbaert (2011, p.6) explain how to calculate the inverse efficiency score (note that PE means proportion of errors):\n\nTo deal with the issue of how to combine speed and error, Townsend and Ashby (1978) proposed the “inverse efficiency score” (IES; see also Townsend & Ashby, 1983). IES can be thought of as an observable measure that gauges the average energy consumed by the system over time (or the power of the system; Townsend & Ashby, 1983, p. 204). It consists of RT divided by 1 - PE (or by PC, the proportion of correct responses). So, for a given participant the mean (or median) RT of the correct responses in a particular condition is calculated and divided by (1-PE) or by PC. Since RTs are expressed in ms and divided by proportions, IES is expressed in ms as well. For instance, if a participant in a particular condition responds with an average RT of 652 ms and makes 5% errors, then IES = 652/(1-.05) = 652/.95 = 686 ms.\n\nPrint all the relevant measures to the screen in one line of text, as in the example below:Enter average reaction time value in ms (between 1 and 2000 ms): 652\nEnter average accuracy score as proportion (between 0 and 1): .9449\nWhen combining an RT of 652 ms and an ACC of 0.9449 (= 5.51% errors), the IES score is 690 ms.\n\n#your code here\n\n","type":"content","url":"/variables-python-exercises#exercise-6-combine-reaction-time-and-accuracy-information","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Python exercises: Variables","lvl3":"Exercise 7.

Your friend (let’s call her Alex) is given an amount of money (say, €10), and is told she should share it with you. Alex can decide how much money you get, and how much she gets. Whatever she apportions to herself is hers to keep, on one condition: you have to agree to her proposal*.* In other words, Alex can propose any division of the money she likes, but the ultimate power lies in your hands: you can accept (and each of you gets your share) or decline (and both of you go home with nothing). What kind of split do you think Alex would suggest?\n\nAccording to classic economic theory, the only reasonable option is for Alex to propose the maximum share for herself (€9) and the minimum for you (€1). After all, you -- the responder -- would surely accept €1 as being better than nothing at all, so why would you decline her offer?\n\nWhen real people were asked to play this Ultimatum Game (Güth, Schmittberger & Schwarze, 1982), however, economics around the world were shocked and astonished to discover that people are not actually all that rational. In fact, responders will often decline unfair offers, even if they, in economic terms, are only shooting themselves in the foot! The players in Alex’s position -- the proposers -- also tend to be much nicer and tend to make proposals that are only slightly unfair.\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_1.json\")\n\nIn this tutorial, we are going to program an Ultimatum game where the proposer (the participant) can either decide to propose a fair offer (5 points for me, 5 points for you) or an unfair offer (7 points for me, 3 points for you). After the proposer decision makes the decision, feedback about the response is shown on the screen. We’ll invent a cover story for the participants: we’ll tell them that the responder is a real person connected to the experiment via the internet. In reality, the responder is a virtual agent and just consists of some lines of Python code that makes decisions in a human-like way -- rational with some random variation. For this virtual responder, we’ll determine the response behaviour using the following algorithm:\n\nWhen a fair offer is made by the proposer, I will accept it 80% of the time; when an unfair offer is made by the proposer, I will accept it only 25% of the time.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/ultimatumgame#introduction","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl2":"Building the framework"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ultimatumgame#building-the-framework","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl2":"Building the framework"},"content":"In this tutorial we will create the entire experiment from scratch, and we will use the ‘default template’, which is already loaded when OpenSesame is launched. Therefore, simply delete the ‘Get started!’ and (if shown) ‘Welcome!’ tabs.\n\nWe will start with building the framework of our experiment. Since we want to get multiple trials for each testing chapter, we start with the outer most layer: the block loop. Insert a block loop after “experiment”, and you should see the following:\n\nFrom here, we define O1_Me and O1_You as choice 1, and O2_Me and O2_You as choice 2. We make a second row where we reverse the order of the choices, and also define which of the two is the fair choice. As of now, we have two trials. We ofcourse want to have more than two trials presented to Player 1. Change the “repeat” parameter to repeat each cycle 5 times.\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_2.json\")\n\nThen, within the block_loop, add a sequence item. We will adapt that later, but for now it’s good to have it in place. Then, we can start adding trial components in the sequence item.\n\nSo, lets think about what we need in terms of OpenSesame objects for one trial. We need:\n\n(1) A sketchpad item for presenting Player 1 two options\n\n(2) A keyboard item to explicitly define which keys Player 1 can press, and to store the answer.\n\n(3) Two sketchpad items for feedback to Player 1. The one which is presented depends on the choice made by Player 1\n\n(4) A sketchpad item that is presented for the duration that Player 1 “waits” for the response of Player 2\n\n(5) An Inline Script item with Python code that determines the choice of Player 2 based on certain probabilities (as defined before)\n\n(6) Two sketchpad items for feedback to player 1 that show which response Player 2 had made. One sketchpad item is presented when Player 2 refuses the offer. The other sketchpad item is presented when Player 2 accepts the offer .\n\nLet’s go through these one by one.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/ultimatumgame#building-the-framework","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl2":"The Decision of Player 1"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ultimatumgame#the-decision-of-player-1","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl2":"The Decision of Player 1"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/ultimatumgame#the-decision-of-player-1","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"1: Sketchpad item for presenting Player 1 with two options","lvl2":"The Decision of Player 1"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/ultimatumgame#id-1-sketchpad-item-for-presenting-player-1-with-two-options","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"1: Sketchpad item for presenting Player 1 with two options","lvl2":"The Decision of Player 1"},"content":"Add in a Sketchpad item, and call it “DecisionMe”.

Here is the Sketchitem how we designed it:\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_3.json\")\n\nWe also need to add a keyboard_response item since we want our Player 1 to choose an option by either pressing 1 or 2. Add a keyboard_response item and set “Allowed responses” to 1 and 2. Note that since there is no correct response, we leave it empty. Furthermore, if you would want the Player to respond within a certain amount of time, you could define a Timeout.

To do that, we will copy the “DecisionMe” sketchpad twice and call those “DecisionMe_feedback1” and “DecisionMe_feedback2”. In one of the sketchpads, we draw a red line around the left box, to indicate that the Player chose that box. In the other sketchpad, we draw a red line around the right box, to indicate that the Player chose that box. To draw the red line you can simply use a red square without fill and draw it around the borders of the decision boxes.\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_4.json\")\n\nNow the trial_sequence item we inserted earlier comes in handy. If we go to that item we see that it automatically added all the items we have created so far. We also see a “Run if” column. OpenSesame defines certain variables themselves (see \n\nhere), and one of them is the [response] variable, which catalogues which response the Player made. So, if we set “run_if” for “DecisionMe_feedback1” to [response] = 1, this sketchpad will only be presented if the Player presses key 1! Do the same for DecionsMe_feedback 2, and it should look like this:\n\n","type":"content","url":"/ultimatumgame#id-2-two-sketchpad-items-for-feedback-to-player-1-the-one-which-is-presented-depends-on-the-choice-made-by-player-1","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"3: A sketchpad item that is presented for the duration that Player 1 “waits” for the response of Player 2","lvl2":"The Decision of Player 1"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/ultimatumgame#id-3-a-sketchpad-item-that-is-presented-for-the-duration-that-player-1-waits-for-the-response-of-player-2","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"3: A sketchpad item that is presented for the duration that Player 1 “waits” for the response of Player 2","lvl2":"The Decision of Player 1"},"content":"This one is easy.

Since we don’t actually have a Player 2, we will now add some artificial intelligence to the experiment that determines Player 2’s decision. Therefore, we will use the feature of OpenSesame to use Python scripts in the trial sequence. The decision of Player 2 should be based on whether the offer of Player 1 is fair or not. If it’s fair, there is a high acceptance rate. If its not fair, there is a low acceptance rate.\n\nFirst, lets make a list of the possible decisions of Player 2, and store that list in a variable called “Decision”. The possible decisions are “Accept” and “Reject”. You can type in the chunk below to make the list.\n\n# decision = ...\n# print(decision)\n\nNow, just to remind ourselves, we want to build a little script that outputs this behaviour: When a fair offer is made by the proposer, I will accept it 80% of the time; when an unfair offer is made by the proposer, I will accept it only 25% of the time.\n\nFor this kind of decision-making, we can make use of an if...else statement. This statement will only run part of the code if a certain test condition is met. Let’s try it out. Write down a script that decides for you if you should or should not eat the banana based on its colour, and prints out the decision.\n\n# banana = \"green\"\n#\n# if banana == ...:\n#     ...\n# else:\n#     ...\n\nIn our case we ofcourse don’t decide between eating or not eating a banana, but between accepting or rejection the offer we got based on how fair the offer is. Lets start by programming an “if...else statement” that always accepts the offer if its fair, and always rejects the offer when its unfair. Call the decision “choice”, and print out the choice made. Test your script by changing the “response” variable to “Fair” or “Unfair”.\n\n# response = \"Fair\"\n#\n# ...\n#\n# print(choice)\n\nThis is a good start. Now, we need to add in the observation that humans in this game don’t always make the same choice. Rather, there is a certain probability (instead of certainty) that a Player accepts or rejects the offer. We need some kind of way to throw a dice each time Player 2 gets an offer, and the probability of the dice landing on “Accept” or “Reject” should depend on the fairness of the offer. As dice-roller, we will make use of the Python module Random, and within that module we will use the choices method. This method picks a value from a list (our decision list in this case), and you can specify the “weights” (how likely it is that an element of a list is chosen) as well. So, let’s build a decision-making if...else statement that accepts the offer 80% of the time when the offer is fair, and accepts the offer just 25% if the offer is unfair. To help yourself, check out \n\nthis link for an explanation of the random.choices() method.\n\n# from random import choices\n#\n# decision = [\"Accept\", \"Reject\"]\n# response = \"Fair\"\n#\n# if ...\n#\n# else...\n#\n# print(decision)\n\nAlright, we have have the body of our Python script that we can use in OpenSesame. Now, there are some OpenSesame specific things that we need to look into. Go back to your OpenSesame UltimatumGame script, and insert an inline_script after the WaitingForOther object. Call this inline_script “OtherDecision”. You will see two tabs: the prepare tab and the run tab. Shortly said, during an experiment the “prepare” script will be ran before the trial starts, and the “run” script will be ran during a trial (for more information see the \n\nOpenSesame website). In our case, what we can already prepare is importing the random.choices() module, and making a list of possible decisions. The actual decision depends on the decision of Player 1, so we will necessarily need to run that in the “run” tab.\n\nThis is our solution to coding the decision of Player 2:\n\nA few things to unpack here in the “run” script. First of all is the way we set the condition:\n\nvar.response == var.Fair_Offer\n\nRemember that the responses possible are “1” or “2”. If you take a look back at our “block_loop”, you see that we map Fair_Offer on “1” or “2”, depending on which decision box (left or right) has the fair offer. So, if the response is 1, and the Fair_Offer is also 1, then that means that was a fair offer!\n\nThen, something that you also probably noticed is that we put a var in front of some variables. This is how OpenSesame communicates with the Python environment, and allows us to use the variables in the OpenSesame. OpenSesame has its own (Python-like) scripting language and environment which is separate from the Python environment. Therefore we need to use tricks like these to build a bridge between the two environments (for more information, see \n\nthis link).\n\nFinally, we have to let Player 1 know what the decision was of Player 2. Therefore, again, we make two sketchpad items. One of which is presented when Player 2 accepts the offer, the other one is presented when Player 2 rejects the offer. Call these sketchpads “AcceptOffer” and “RejectOffer”. These sketchpads should communicate the outcome of Player 2’s decision. Then, go back to the “trial_sequence” object, and change the “Run if” of the “AcceptOffer” and “RejectOffer”:\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_5.json\")\n\nAs you saw in the question, something there is happening that we probably would not want to have. If there is no offer given, there shouldn’t be a response from Player 2. Starting from our decision script for Player 2, can you find a solution so that, when no response is given, Player 2 simply doesn’t do anything? In OpenSesame, if no response is made the “response” variable is set to “None”. Furthermore, it’s important to print out the choice made, only if there was a choice. Note that there are multiple solutions.\n\n# from random import choices\n#\n# decision = [\"Accept\", \"Reject\"]\n# response = \"None\" # Change it to \"Fair\" and \"Unfair\" to test your script\n#\n# if response == \"Fair\":\n#     choice = choices(decision, weights = [80, 20], k=1)\n# else:\n#     choice = choices(decision, weights = [25, 75], k=1)\n#\n# print(choice)\n\n","type":"content","url":"/ultimatumgame#id-4-an-inline-script-item-with-python-code-that-determines-the-choice-of-player-2-based-on-certain-probabilities-as-defined-before","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl2":"Logging results and running the experiment"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ultimatumgame#logging-results-and-running-the-experiment","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Ultimatum Game in OpenSesame","lvl2":"Logging results and running the experiment"},"content":"Now we have everything to run the experiment.

OpenSesame gives you a really easy way to store every single variable of each trial (including the variables we defined ourselves). Therefore, insert a “logger” item after the RejectOffer and AcceptOffer items. We call the logger item “LogTrials”. Furthermore, it’s also important to don’t start right away with an experiment, but first give instructions. So add instructions before the “block_loop”, and a logger item at the end of the “trial_sequence”, and it should look something like this:\n\nNow we are set to run the experiment, and record everything we want (and way more).

Kipling D. Williams came up with this idea after a Frisbee rolled up and hit him in the back when relaxing in a park in 1983:\n\nHe turned around, saw two other guys looking at him expectantly, and threw the Frisbee back to them. He was a bit surprised when they threw the disk back to him; he walked toward them to form a triangle, and threw it back again. For about a minute, the three of them threw the Frisbee around in a spirited game of catch. What happened next sparked an idea as to how to study the effects of ostracism. For no apparent reason, the two original players started throwing the Frisbee only to each other, and never threw it to the newcomer again. After sheepishly back-stepping toward his dog, the author was amazed at how bad he felt. He was sad, embarrassed, and a bit angry. He wondered what he had done to warrant being ostracised by the other two players. He sought comfort from his faithful dog. Then, it occurred to him that something like this, adapted for the laboratory, would be an excellent means to study ostracism and social exclusion. (Williams & Jarvis, 2006, p.174).\n\nThese are the instructions participants usually receive:\n\n\"Welcome to Cyberball, the Interactive Ball-Tossing Game Used for Mental Visualisation!\n\nIn the upcoming experiment, we test the effects of practising mental visualisation on task performance. Thus, we need you to practise your mental visualisation skills. We have found that the best way to do this is to have you play an on-line game of catch with other participants who are logged on at the same time.\n\nIn a few moments, you will be playing a game of catch with other students over our network. The game is very simple. When the ball is tossed to you, simply use the keyboard to indicate the player (with numerical key 1 or 3) you want to throw it to. When the game is over, the experimenter will give you additional instructions.\n\nWhat is important is not your ball tossing performance, but that you MENTALLY VISUALISE the entire experience. Imagine what the others look like. What sort of people are they? Where are you playing? Is it warm and sunny, or cold and rainy? Create in your mind a complete mental picture of what might be going on if you were playing this game in real life.\n\nOkay, ready to begin?\"\n\nThis is what the game looks like at the start:\n\n","type":"content","url":"/cyberball#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Cyberball game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Step 1: Programming the basic experimental flow","lvl2":"Introduction"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/cyberball#step-1-programming-the-basic-experimental-flow","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Cyberball game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Step 1: Programming the basic experimental flow","lvl2":"Introduction"},"content":"To program the game, you first need some movie clips that show a ball moving between the players. You need six of them depicting all possible directions:\n\nFrom player 1 to player 2 \n\n1to2.wmv\nFrom player 1 to player 3 \n\n1to3.wmv\nFrom player 2 to player 1 \n\n2to1.wmv\nFrom player 2 to player 3 \n\n2to3.wmv\nFrom player 3 to player 1 \n\n3to1.wmv\nFrom player 3 to player 2 \n\n3to2.wmv\n\nThe six movie files can be downloaded using the links.\n\nNote that these small Windows Media Files have been converted from the original animated gifs that are freely available on \n\nK.D. Williams’ website.\n\nNow let’s draw the basic flow chart for each trial, which determines which movies should be played when:\n\nThis flow chart basically decides who is throwing the ball in this trial (Player 1, Player 2, or Player 3) and, by retrieving the values from a variable (column) from the OpenSesame Loop object (see next step), it will decide the destination of the ball.\n\nLet’s create the entire experiment from scratch and use the ‘default template’, which is already loaded when OpenSesame is launched. You can simple delete the ‘Get started!’ and copy paste the introduction described above in the welcome sketchpad.\n\nAlso, make sure you download and add all six video files mentioned above to the File pool first. Also, set the back-end of the experiment to legacy.\n\nAt any moment during the experiment we need to have access to the information about which player currently has the ball. So, create a new variable named current_player with the initial value 1, in a new inline_script called init_exp at the beginning of your experiment procedure (the game always starts with Player 1 throwing the ball). As shown here:\n\nvar.current_player = 1\n\nNow you can implement the basic branching structure using conditional via the \n\nrun-if statement of the sequence.\n\nDepending on the value in current_player, the script may run one single trial in either player1_loop, player2_loop, or player3_loop. In order to do so, we make use of a combination of loops run in a trial_seq. Build a basic setup running 60 trials, as in the example below. Some of you may realize already that with this solution there can be multiple throws in one trial; let’s forget about this issue for now and fix it later, i.e. in Exercise 1).\n\nNote that we used the Python syntax for the conditional statements. You can also use the OpenSesame syntax again in which case you omit the =var. and instead use square brackets around the variable name.\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_1.json\")\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/cyberball#step-1-programming-the-basic-experimental-flow","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Cyberball game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Step 2: Programming the behaviour of Player 1 and Player 3","lvl2":"Introduction"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/cyberball#step-2-programming-the-behaviour-of-player-1-and-player-3","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Cyberball game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Step 2: Programming the behaviour of Player 1 and Player 3","lvl2":"Introduction"},"content":"Let’s now think about how to set up the player1_loop and player3_loop. These loops should retrieve the new destination that the virtual Players 1 and 3 will toss the ball to. So add a variable (column) in both loops named target_player and type in the possible destinations of that player (a player is not allowed to toss the ball to themselves! It would be an interesting extension of the paradigm, though...).\n\nThese loops fully determine the behaviour of Player 1 and Player 3. It’s up to you whether you want to make this behaviour predictable (use sequential selection), fully random (use random selection), or preferential (increase the number of rows of specific target players).\n\nThe example below implements a very predictable and non-preferential playing style for both players.\n\n\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_2.json\")\n\nNow let these loops run a sequence called play1_seq and play3_seq that contain an inline_script (name the scripts prepare_player1 and prepare_player3 respectively) and a subsequently presented media player media_player_mpy.\n\nMake sure you use the same media player object in both sequences (Hint: use the Copy (linked) - Paste feature using right mouse button clicks in the Overview area).\n\nHint: the media player object is available under the Visual stimuli header, at the bottom of the Toolbar (if you have a small screen resolution, it might be hidden under the small arrows pointing down).\n\nEdit the media_player_mpy object in the following way:\n\nRefer to the variable movie_filename in the Video file field\n\nSet the Duration property to sound so that this object is presented for the entire duration of the video\n\nFinally, give the variable movie_filename the initial (temporary) file name “'1to2.wmv” in the init_exp script. So add the following line there:\n\nvar.movie_filename = \"1to2.wmv\"\n\nNow, add this code in PreparePlayer1:\n\nvar.movie_filename = \"1to\" + str(var.target_player) + \".wmv\"\nvar.current_player = var.target_player # info for next trial\nitems.prepare(\"media_player_mpy\")\n\ndisplay_quiz(\"questions/question_3.json\")\n\nThis script overwrites the temporary filename in the MovieDisplay with the correct filename. The second line is also very important. Here, the value of the variable current_player is updated to the new destination, so that in the next trial the branching structure knows who is at that moment the current_player. Finally, because of the \n\nprepare-run strategy in OpenSesame, the temporary filename was used to prepare the media player at the start of the trial. To make sure the media player is updated and shows the proper file, we manually prepare it again using the items.prepare command.\n\nAlmost the same code should be added to the PreparePlayer3 InLine:\n\nvar.movie_filename = \"3to\" + str(var.target_player) + \".wmv\"\nvar.current_player = var.target_player # info for next trial\nitems.prepare(\"media_player_mpy\")\n\n","type":"content","url":"/cyberball#step-2-programming-the-behaviour-of-player-1-and-player-3","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Cyberball game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Step 3: Programming Player 2","lvl2":"Introduction"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/cyberball#step-3-programming-player-2","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Cyberball game in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Step 3: Programming Player 2","lvl2":"Introduction"},"content":"Let’s now add a Procedure named play2_seq to the player2_loop.

Add the following code in the loop that presents the frames:\n\nclock.sleep(1000/fps)\n\nTry whether this works!\n\nAssume you run this code on a very slow or a very fast computer. You will notice that the movie might be presented at a different pace! This is because runnign the code itself also takes time and even a few milliseconds delay can over time accumulate into a distorted presentation.\n\nBecause the code that presents the picture also needs some time, we actually need a smarter piece of code that only waits if there is time remaining after all the other works has been done. So we need a function like the clock.tick() described \n\nhere.\n\nThe function below mimics the functionality of the clock.tick method:\n\ndef myclocktick(foo):\n  #inspired by clock.tick\n  #see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34383559/pygame-clock-tick-vs-framerate-in-game-main-loop\n  if var.has(u'prevt'):\n        diff = ((1000/foo) - (clock.time() - var.prevt) ) - 10\n        if diff>0:\n            clock.sleep(diff)\n\n  var.prevt = clock.time()\n\nHere, foo is used as a metasyntactic variable or a placeholder for a value that can change.\n\nPaste this code in the Prepare tab of the play_movie inline script. Then, in the Run tab replace the clock.sleep code with the following line:\n\nmyclocktick(fps)\n\nTry whether you notice any differences.

So, when span 10 is reached it will use 10 different numbers. This is done at two moments (the same script is called in two locations!): at the beginning of the experiment (before the loop runs) and at the end of each trial, i.e. before a new trial is prepared.\n\nThis is the first part of this code:\n\nnums=[1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9]\nrandom.shuffle(nums)\nnum0=random.choice(nums)\nnum1=random.choice(nums)\nnum2=random.choice(nums)\nnum3=random.choice(nums)\nnum4=random.choice(nums)\nnum5=random.choice(nums)\nnum6=random.choice(nums)\nnum7=random.choice(nums)\nnum8=random.choice(nums)\nnum9=random.choice(nums)\n\nIn the remainder of the code the temporary variables are used to assign the values to the experimental variables using the exp.set method.\n\nHowever, the experiment is programmed in such a way that number 7 has a special status: if a value in a sequence equals 7 it is skipped (see the Run if conditionals in the Trials sequences. This may be the reason why the creator of this task decided to pick random numbers from the range [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9] WITH replacement.\n\nLet’s change the task a little bit by using letters instead of numbers and let’s not allow for using the same value multiple times (random WITHOUT replacement). To do so, we can randomly shuffle the order of a range of letters and use a unique location from this reshuffled range for each of the 10 experiment variables (num0 up to num9).\n\nIn order to do so, change the piece of code indicated above in the following (complete the ... lines). We are going to create the relevant code in the browser first and will paste it into OpenSesame later on.\n\nComplete the code below and run it in the browser:\n\nimport random\nnums=[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\",\"F\",\"G\",\"H\",\"I\",\"J\"]\nrandom.shuffle(nums)\nnum0=nums[0]\nnum1=nums[1]\nnum2=nums[2]\nnum3=nums[3]\nnum4=nums[4]\n#...\n#...\n#...\n#...\n#...\nprint(num0)\nprint(num1)\n#...\n#...\n#...\n#...\n#...\n\nAs a next step, we can simply concatenate all nine variables to a single string and print the content (again: complete the code at ...)\n\nimport random\nseq_presented = num0 + num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 # + ...\nprint(seq_presented)\n\nThe Run-If logic in the Trials sequences only presents the first x items, depending on the current Nback span. Let’s therefore print only the number of characters that is indicated in the Nback variable.\n\nThe code below does this. Check whether it works if you change Nback to another number.\n\nNback = 2\nseq_presented = seq_presented[0:Nback]\nprint(seq_presented)\n\nLet’s now make it even more fancy and raise an exception if current_span > maximum length of the sequence. This can be done using the following code:\n\nNback = 4\nif Nback > len(seq_presented):\n    raise Exception('Invalid value for Nback (%s)' % Nback)\n\nseq_presented = seq_presented[0:Nback]\nprint(seq_presented)\n\nIf your code works well in the browser, let’s go back to OpenSesame and add it in the proper locations: the code for the presented stimuli should be inserted into GenerateNums and replace the part that refers to numbers.\n\nIn addition, add a python inline script before the logger and call it process_trial\n\nAdd the code that calculates the seq_presented in this inline.\n\nMake sure you start references to the relevant variables in OpenSesame with var. so OpenSesame knows these are experimental variables that can be accessed in the gui and can be properly logged.\n\nNote\n\n The temporary variables and the experimental variables have the same names in the original example. This is not recommended because it will become very confusing. If you use vars.num0=nums[0], you no longer need the exp.set(“num0”,num0) lines.\n\nRun the experiment.

Again, let’s first try this out in the browser.\n\nIn order to compare whether the response of the user (logged in the response experiment variable in OpenSesame, see Answer object) equals the actual sequences presented we can use the following code. Change the value assigned to response to test whether this works properly.\n\nresponse = \"fcd\"\nif (response == seq_presented):\n    print(\"Correct sequence\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Incorrect sequence\")\n\nLet’s now make the code a bit smarter. First, let’s make the comparison insentive to the case by making all letters captical using the .upper function. Second, let’s remove spaces that could have been accidentially added by the user using the .strip function.

Above each question, we present a rectangle of height 1 pixel (basically a line) named qst01bg to qst10bg. We also create a “Continue” button to proceed to the next sheet. And around all 90 options there is rectangle that can get colors black (indicating it is selected) or the background color of the canvas (white), indicating it is not selected. These rectangles are named rbxxx  (rb011 to rb019 for the first question, rb021 to rb029 for the second question, et cetera).\n\nWe first sketched this outline on a piece of paper and then played around with finding some nice coordinates at the screen.

However, if we change the canvas, we have to redraw the canvas to the screen\n\nwe keep showing the screen as long as the user (participant) has not clicked the OK button (to do so we will use a loop that continuously runs some code while we do not update the screen; the user is simply not aware of this loop because the screen stays the same)\n\nwe do not have to update the cursus position on the screen each time the mouse moves. This is automatically done by the Operating System.\n\nNow you need a piece of paper (or a tool like MS Visio) to sketch a diagram that does all of this in a way that makes sense. For example, the diagram below shows one implementation of a solution. Note that the diagram is still a bit simplified and we need a couple of more nested loops and decisions to make everything work perfectly.\n\nLet’s try to describe what the diagram shows. We basically have a big loop that is repeated as long as the user does not press the OK button (once enabled). Within the loop, we first wait for a mouse click. We then check whether the user clicked the option or the OK button and take the actions as described in the flow chart. After that we check whether all questions are answered and enabled the OK button in that case. Finally, if a refresh of the screen is needed we draw the updated canvas to the screen (otherwise, the screen is not updated and hence stays as it was).\n\nThere are at least two “states” of the experiment that we should keep in the working memory of the computer: 1) whether the OK button was selected or not (this is checked each time at the top of the loop), and 2) whether a refresh of the screen is needed (this state is TRUE when the OK button is enabled and/or when the user made a new selection).\n\nOpen the refr_qcanvas inline and add the following lines to the top of the script. This gives initial values to the variables that save the two “states” which can be changed later on in the script.\n\nOK_pressed = False\nrefresh_needed = True\n\n","type":"content","url":"/questionnaire#step-7-continously-update-the-content-of-the-canvas-until-the-user-clicks-continue","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Optional: Questionnaires in OpenSesame","lvl3":"Add the big loop","lvl2":"Step 7.

Add the following code below the wait for mouse click code.\n\n    if pos is not None:\n        x, y = pos\n        print('Clicked on elements: %s' % my_canvas.elements_at(x, y))\n\nNow run the experiment in Windowed mode (>> button) and check which results you see in the output console.

We basically know that not all questions are answered if there are still elements in RSelected with the value 0.\n\nTo translate this logic in a script we create a new variable called allselected and we give it initial value of True (assuming all questions are answered). We now loop over all 10 questions and check whether the associated RSelected value is 0. Whenever this happens, we ‘veto’ the decision and set allselected to False. We need the following code for this:\n\n    #check if all selections are made already\n    allselected = True\n    for i in range(1,10+1):\n        if (RSelected[i-1] == 0):\n            allselected = False\n\nLet’s now consider a slightly different scenario. Assume that in some cases we do not to fill all 10 questions in a sheet. For example, when we have a questionnaire with 25 items, 2 sheets can present 10 items and the final sheet only 5 items. Of course we do not require participant to make a selection of an option that does not have a question.\n\nSo let’s change the code and only ‘veto’ the decision if the Rselected value is 0 and at the same time the related question is not empty:\n\n    #check if all selections are made already\n    allselected = True\n    for i in range(1,10+1):\n        if (RSelected[i-1] == 0) & (my_canvas['qst' + str(i).zfill(2)].text != \"\"):\n            allselected = False\n\nInsert this code before the check if a refresh is needed. Now, we finally also need to ‘enable’ the OK button by making the text color ‘black’ when allselected equals True\n\n    if allselected:\n        #enable OK button\n        my_canvas[\"OKbutton_t\"].color = u'black'\n\nNote that we do not have to set refresh_need to True once more because the allselected status will by definition only change when an option is clicked (which itself forces a refresh already).\n\nCheck whether the questionnare works properly now and proceeds to the next sheet of questions after you click Proceed.

So there are likely more than 60 throws presented in this experiment. If you set the number of trials to 1 you see that this trial first let player 1 throw the ball, and after that 2 or 3 throws the ball in the same trial. This happens because each for each player_loop it is checked, independently of each other (!), whether current_player equals the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Because player_loop2 and player_loop3 will be run after player_loop1, the first trial will already present two throws (1>2 then 2>3, or 1>3 then 3>2) or even three or more throws (e.g. 1>2, then 2>1, then 1>2 or 3 etc.).\n\nThe full solution for this step can be downloaded [here] (\n\nhttps://​downgit​.github​.io​/​#​/home​?url​=​https://​github​.com​/henkvs​/experimentation​_i​_2324​/blob​/main​/content​/solutions​/Cyberball​_loops05​_2​_Exercise1​-rev1​.osexp)\n\n","type":"content","url":"/solutions#exercise-3-fixing-the-issue-of-incorrect-number-of-trials","position":97},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Solutions","lvl4":"Exercise 4.

The objective of the script is:\n\nShow Pos smiley when response is correct and <=500ms.\n\nShow Neutral smiley when response is correct but slow (>500ms).\n\nShow Negative stimuli when response is incorrect, or in the absense of a response (‘too late’ as written in the PDF).\n\nUnlike in the solution uploaded above, it is usually better to avoid comparisons with RTs to look for missing responses.\n\nAlways go for checking missed responses directly like var.response_keyboard_response !='None'.\n\nSticking to RT checks is error prone. If you change the time allowed for the response elsewhere in the experiment (may be to debug or pilot the experiment), you might have to change the way you detect missed responses too.\n\nDifferent software use different RTs for missed responses. RT for missed responses is 0 in Eprime, ‘[ ]’ in Psychopy, or a few microsenconds higher than max limit of the keyboard object (around 1000.50ms in this experiment).\n\nHence the following code is recommended as a form of best practice.if var.response_keyboard_response !='None':\n    if var.correct == 1 and var.response_time_keyboard_response <= 500:\n        var.smiley = 1 #positive\n        var.totalPoints = var.totalPoints + 20\n    elif var.correct == 1 and var.response_time_keyboard_response > 500:\n        var.smiley = 3 #neutral\n        var.totalPoints = var.totalPoints + 0\n    else:\n        var.smiley = 2 #negative\n        var.totalPoints = var.totalPoints - 20\nelse:\n    var.smiley = 2 #negative\n    var.totalPoints = var.totalPoints - 20\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"content","url":"/solutions#opensesame-solutions-extra-exercises","position":159},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Solutions","lvl2":"Extra Python exercises: Multiplication Table"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/solutions#extra-python-exercises-multiplication-table","position":160},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Solutions","lvl2":"Extra Python exercises: Multiplication Table"},"content":"\n\n# 1\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    print(i)\n\n# 2\nm = 5 # Change this to any integer you want\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    print(i,\"x\",m)\n\n# 3\nm = 5 # Change this to any integer you want\n\nfor i in range(1,11):\n    x = i * m\n    print(i,\"x\",m,\"=\",x)\n\n# 4\ndef print_multiplication_table(m):\n    for i in range(1,11):\n        x = i * m\n        print(i,\"x\",m,\"=\",x)\n\nprint_multiplication_table(9)\n\n# 5\nfor m in range(1, 11):\n    print(f\"The multiplication table of {m}:\")\n    print() # Optional for readability\n    print_multiplication_table(m)\n    print() # Optional for readability\n\n\n# OR \nfor m in range(1, 11):\n    print(f\"The multiplication table of {m}:\\n\") # Way nicer actually!\n    print_multiplication_table(m)\n    print()\n\n# 6\ngroup4 = [1,2,5,10]\ngroup5 = [3,4,6,7,8,9]\n\nprint(\"The following multiplication tables are learned in group 4\")\nfor m in group4:\n    print(f\"The multiplication table of {m}:\")\n    print()\n    print_multiplication_table(m)\n    print()\n\nprint(\"The following multiplication tables are learned in group 5\")\nfor m in group5:\n    print(f\"The multiplication table of {m}:\")\n    print()\n    print_multiplication_table(m)\n    print()\n\n# 7\ngroup4 = [1,2,5,10]\ngroup5 = [3,4,6,7,8,9]\n\ndef group_number_chosen(group_number):\n    if group_number == 4:\n        print(\"The following multiplication tables are learned in group 4\")\n        for m in group4:\n            print(f\"The multiplication table of {m}:\")\n            print()\n            print_multiplication_table(m)\n            print()\n\n    elif group_number == 5:\n        print(\"The following multiplication tables are learned in group 5\")\n        for m in group5:\n            print(f\"The multiplication table of {m}:\")\n            print()\n            print_multiplication_table(m)\n            print()\n\ngroup_number_chosen(4)\n\n# 8\ndef test_multiplication_table(m):\n    score = 0\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        answer = int(input(f\"{m} x {i} = \"))\n        if answer == m * i:\n            print(\"Correct!\")\n            score += 1\n        else:\n            print(f\"Incorrect.

This course is part of the \n\nresearch master program in Psychology at \n\nLeiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nUsing this material, you can learn how to build experiments using OpenSesame and get a primer into basic coding using python. Like the software packages we will be using, all of the material in this course is open and freely available. Please note that the compiled JupyterBook is a collection of teaching material from various sources, and it heavily relies on and integrates earlier work generously provided by others online. We always acknowledge the work of these contributors whenever we use their material. The major contributors are mentioned below.\n\nHow to use this material?\n\nMake sure you save your work in a well-organized folder structure. Some of the later exercises build on work you did earlier during the course.\n\nWe have provided solutions to all exercises \n\nhere. Just keep in mind that there are often multiple ways to solve a problem, so if you come up with a different solution, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re wrong. Don’t forget that figuring out how to solve a problem on your own is an important part of the learning process and can be incredibly fulfilling. Embrace the challenge and take pride in your ability to find solutions independently!\n\nIf you’re taking this course in-person at Leiden University: This course material is partially covered in an intensive eight-week course at Leiden University, where you will participate in plenary and practical sessions to receive live feedback and help. No prior programming knowledge is assumed.\n\nIf you’re teaching yourself: We understand that it can be challenging to self-teach OpenSesame and python, and you may need help from a more experienced classmate or colleague, particularly during the exercises. If you are interested in having a similar course organized by us at your institute, please feel free to \n\ncontact us to discuss possibilities.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nOur course is a renewed version of an \n\nearlier course that Henk led at Leiden University for over a decade. This course focused on E-Prime and accompanied the book \n\nThe E-Primer, which was written together with Michiel Spape, Rinus Verdonschot, and Saskia van Dantzig, my esteemed colleagues at Leiden University in the early days. Although the current course is more focused on coding than the previous course, we still owe a lot of inspiration from the earlier book and even have reused parts of this book in the current course. Our initial discussions with Dirk van Morselaar (VU Amsterdam) were also really influential and helped us to make python coding a central part of this course.\n\nAdditionally, many of the lessons and python exercises in this course are based on the \n\n“Python for Everyone” course provided by Charles R. Severance. We are grateful for the opportunity to integrate his open material into this course.\n\nSome of the OpenSesame tutorials in this course directly come from the \n\nOpenSesame website developed and maintained by Sebastian Mathot and his colleagues. We thank Sebastian for his help and the useful advice he provided.\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the authors whose tutorials we were able to include in this course, especially James E. Bartlett and Todd M. Gureckis, as well as all the other researchers who have generously made their material available online for us to use in our course.\n\nFinally, we are grateful to the teaching team at Leiden University who have contributed to this course and provided helpful feedback on the materials, including Xaver Funk, Selin Topel, Samarth Varma, and Jin Yan. We would also like to thank Anne Urai, Guido Band, Sander Nieuwenhuis, Ili Ma, the technicians of the SOLO lab support team, members of the research master committee, and members of the \n\nOpen Science Community Leiden for their contributions and support.\n\nLast but not least, we are grateful to the board of the faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Leiden University for awarding us a Grass shoots grant, which allowed us to develop the teaching material for this course.\n\nLeiden, January 2024\n\nJeshua Tromp, PhD student\n\nauthor and workgroup instructor\n\nDr. Henk van Steenbergen, Associate Professor and PI at the \n\nAffect, Motivation and Action lab\n\nauthor and course coordinator","type":"content","url":"/intro","position":1}]}
