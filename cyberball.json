For about a minute, the three of them threw the Frisbee around in a spirited game of catch. What happened next sparked an idea as to how to study the effects of ostracism. For no apparent reason, the two original players started throwing the Frisbee only to each other, and never threw it to the newcomer again. After sheepishly back-stepping toward his dog, the author was amazed at how bad he felt. He was sad, embarrassed, and a bit angry. He wondered what he had done to warrant being ostracised by the other two players. He sought comfort from his faithful dog. Then, it occurred to him that something like this, adapted for the laboratory, would be an excellent means to study ostracism and social exclusion.
