We can change this to 500 to make the screen disappear after 500ms. Whenever you specify a duration in OpenSesame, it is stated in milliseconds. Therefore, to present something for 1 second, we would need to write 1000. Finally, we can change the name of the component to something informative such as fixation.

If you are interested in using a more robust outlier removal method, Leys et al. (2013) present an alternative using the absolute median deviation. As the outlier removal method differs between studies and topic, in this guide we will just focus on removing incorrect responses, and response times below 100ms and above 1000ms. When it comes to designing your own studies, you will need to look more closely at these articles and methods.","position":{"start":{"line":111,"column":1},"end":{"line":111,"column":1}},"key":"CiqiiqURH4"}],"key":"pYuWV8uPTV"},{"type":"heading","depth":4,"position":{"start":{"line":113,"column":1},"end":{"line":113,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Identifying extreme responses","position":{"start":{"line":113,"column":1},"end":{"line":113,"column":1}},"key":"oohG4iiM6i"}],"identifier":"identifying-extreme-responses","label":"Identifying extreme responses","html_id":"identifying-extreme-responses","implicit":true,"key":"dvtcb3Es99"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":115,"column":1},"end":{"line":115,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In order to process the data, we will do it in two steps.
